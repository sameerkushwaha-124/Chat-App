- **Implementation**: Configuration in `vite.config.js`
- **Benefits**: Fast development server, efficient bundling for production

### State Management & Routing

#### Zustand
- **Purpose**: Lightweight state management library
- **Role**: Manages global application state
- **Implementation**: Store definitions likely in a dedicated store directory
- **Benefits**: Simpler than Redux, reduces boilerplate code, works with hooks

#### React Router DOM
- **Purpose**: Declarative routing for React applications
- **Role**: Manages navigation between different views
- **Implementation**: Router setup typically in main application component
- **Features**: Dynamic route matching, nested routes, route parameters

### UI & Styling

#### Tailwind CSS
- **Purpose**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Role**: Provides pre-designed utility classes for styling components
- **Implementation**: Configuration in `tailwind.config.js`
- **Usage**: Applied directly in component JSX via class names

#### DaisyUI
- **Purpose**: Component library for Tailwind CSS
- **Role**: Provides pre-built UI components styled with Tailwind
- **Implementation**: Added as a plugin in Tailwind configuration
- **Components**: Buttons, cards, modals, forms, etc.

#### Lucide React
- **Purpose**: Icon library for React
- **Role**: Provides clean, consistent icons for the UI
- **Implementation**: Imported as React components
- **Usage**: Used for navigation icons, action buttons, etc.

### Network & Communication

#### Axios
- **Purpose**: Promise-based HTTP client
- **Role**: Makes API requests to the backend server
- **Implementation**: Likely set up with base URL and interceptors for authentication
- **Features**: Request/response interception, automatic JSON transformation, error handling

#### Socket.io Client
- **Purpose**: Client library for Socket.io
- **Role**: Establishes and maintains WebSocket connection with the server
- **Implementation**: Socket connection setup, event listeners and emitters
- **Usage**: Real-time message sending/receiving, online status updates, typing indicators

### Developer Experience

#### ESLint
- **Purpose**: Code linting tool
- **Role**: Enforces coding standards and catches potential issues
- **Implementation**: Configuration in `eslint.config.js`
- **Benefits**: Consistent code style, early error detection

#### TypeScript Support
- **Purpose**: Static type checking for JavaScript
- **Role**: Provides type definitions for React and DOM elements
- **Implementation**: Type definitions available for development
- **Benefits**: Better code completion, type checking during development

#### React Hot Toast
- **Purpose**: Toast notification library
- **Role**: Displays non-intrusive notifications to users
- **Implementation**: Notification provider wrapped around app
- **Usage**: Success/error messages, alerts, notifications

## Communication Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials in the frontend login form
2. Frontend sends credentials to backend via Axios
3. Backend validates credentials and creates JWT token
4. Token is sent back to frontend and stored (localStorage/cookies)
5. Subsequent API requests include this token for authentication

### Real-time Messaging Flow
1. User logs in and establishes Socket.io connection with server
2. User joins specific chat rooms (private conversations or group chats)
3. When user sends a message:
   - Frontend emits Socket.io event with message data
   - Backend receives event, processes message, stores in MongoDB
   - Backend broadcasts message to all users in the specific chat room
   - Recipients' frontends receive Socket.io event and update UI in real-time
4. Additional events handle typing indicators, read receipts, online status

### API Communication
1. Frontend makes HTTP requests to backend endpoints using Axios
2. Backend processes requests through Express routes and controllers
3. Controllers interact with MongoDB via Mongoose models
4. Response data is sent back to frontend as JSON
5. Frontend updates state using Zustand and re-renders components as needed

## Development and Deployment

### Development Workflow
1. **Backend Development**: Run with `npm run dev` for Nodemon auto-restart
2. **Frontend Development**: Run with `npm run dev` for Vite dev server with HMR
3. **Building**: Full project build with `npm run build` from root directory

### Project Structure
- **Backend**:
  - `controllers/`: Request handlers for different resources
  - `models/`: Mongoose schema definitions
  - `routes/`: API endpoint definitions
  - `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions
  - `index.js`: Main application entry point

- **Frontend**:
  - `src/components/`: Reusable UI components
  - `src/pages/`: Full page components corresponding to routes
  - `src/store/`: Zustand state management
  - `src/services/`: API service functions
  - `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks

### Deployment Considerations
- Backend requires Node.js runtime environment
- MongoDB database needed (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)
- Frontend builds to static files that can be served by any web server
- Environment variables should be properly set for production environment
